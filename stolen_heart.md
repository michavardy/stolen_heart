# The Stolen Heart

## Act 1 Scene 1: Theft from Girl

**EXT. PARK - DAY**

A family walks home from the park: a mother, father, and two kids. One girl, **ROMI** (10), wears a golden necklace.

**NICHOLAS JULIAS** (30s, shabby) strolls through the park. He notices the necklace. Slowly, he extends his hand, skillfully unclasps the necklace, and pockets it.

**PARENTS**: (talking about work)  
**ROMI**: (distressed) Dad! I can't find my necklace, the golden one.  
**FATHER**: (annoyed) We are talking about work! Don't interrupt.

Nicholas helps them find their parents and then disappears into the crowd.

## Act 1 Scene 3: Second Theft

**EXT. STREET - DAY**

**ELLA AMILI** (20s, stylish) walks with confidence. She wears high heels, a long dress, a fancy purse, and golden accessories.

**NICHOLAS JULIAS**, now poor and hungry, with no shoes and dirty clothes, begs for food, but no one listens. He notices a pink crystal in Ella's bag. Desperate, he grabs her bag and pulls.

**ELLA**: (panicked) Help, help! This man is trying to steal my bag!

**NICHOLAS**: (puts his hand on her mouth) Stop yelling! You're going to get me in trouble.

A **POLICEMAN** takes pictures of the theft unnoticed.

**ELLA**: Don't I know you from somewhere?  
**NICHOLAS**: Yeah, I think we were in high school together. My name is Nicholas Julias.  
**ELLA**: Wow, you were always the smartest kid in class. What happened to you?  
**NICHOLAS**: My parents lost all our money. They were irresponsible and criminal. I promised myself I would never steal, but I was just so hungry. I haven't eaten for a week. I am so ashamed.  
**ELLA**: Oh my God, that is horrible. Please, let me buy you lunch.

## Act 2 Scene 1: The Love of the Roses

**INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY**

The scene opens in a very fancy restaurant. Everyone is very proper and drinking wine. On the table are meats, sauces, wines, and napkins. Ella finds a table.

**ELLA**: This is the least I could do.

Nicholas is so hungry. He takes handfuls of salad, steak, and jello right out of the serving tray. Dirt is all over the serving tray. He drinks the sauce straight from the container. Everyone looks at him weirdly and cringes.

**NICHOLAS**: Wow, this is the fanciest meal I've ever eaten. No one has treated me with such kindness before. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  
**ELLA**: Wow, I didn't know that you could respect me. Your words are so beautiful. I feel like you're kind too.

**NICHOLAS**: What a dream. These past few months have been amazing. I'm so in love with you.  
**ELLA**: I'm really in love with you. Thank you for the respect.

**ELLA**: It is very important to me that you come to my house and meet my parents.  
**NICHOLAS**: I'm not sure that I'm ready to meet your parents.  
**ELLA**: It will mean so much to me!  
**NICHOLAS**: Okay, I guess it will be fine.  
**ELLA**: Come this Friday at 6 o'clock to Montiofori 44. I purchased clothes for the dinner. Wear these.

She hands him a bag of clothes.

**ELLA**: Please bring as a gift four red roses. I'll see you then.

Ella leaves happy, but Nicholas is worried.

## Act 3 Scene 1: Dinner

**INT. AMILI HOUSE - EVENING**

Nicholas rings the doorbell, carrying four red roses. The **BUTLER** answers the door.

**BUTLER**: Good evening, sir. The Amili family is expecting you in the east wing. Please follow me.

Nicholas follows the butler to a large table. **MR.** and **MRS. AMILI** sit on opposite sides of the table. Ella sits in the middle. A giant chandelier with candle sticks and diamonds hangs above. The table is set with flowers, candles, bottles of wine, pasta della Roma, pizza, and steaks.

**MR. AMILI**: We welcome you to our table. Please sit down and enjoy this modest meal.  
**MRS. AMILI**: Servant, please take this boy's coat and hat.

**NICHOLAS**: Good evening. I brought you these four red roses as a present. Thank you so much for your gracious hospitality.

**MR. AMILI**: Yes, yes. Put them over there in the vase.

Nicholas places the roses in the vase and then sits down opposite Ella.

**BUTLER**: Sir, would you prefer the boiled goose or frog legs?

Nicholas looks confused. Ella answers for him.

**ELLA**: He would like the goose, please.  
**BUTLER**: Excellent. And which wine pairing will you be enjoying this evening?  
**ELLA**: He will be drinking white Chardonnay, the 1988 special edition.  
**BUTLER**: Very well, sir. Enjoy your meal.

## Act 3 Scene 2: The Interrogation

**MR. AMILI**: So, Nicholas, tell me, what kind of work are you into?  
**NICHOLAS**: Well, I'm in between jobs at the moment.  
**MR. AMILI**: Interesting. And which university did you attend?  
**NICHOLAS**: University is great fun, but I have been applying myself currently in the field.  
**MRS. AMILI**: Oh, very practical.  
**MR. AMILI**: And which field exactly?  
**ELLA**: (interjecting) My father is an interrogator in the police.  
**MR. AMILI**: What did you say your full name is?  
**NICHOLAS**: My full name is Nicholas Julias.  
**MR. AMILI**: Please excuse me. I must visit the lavatory. I shall return in an instant.

Mr. Amili goes into a secret room, closes the door, and locks it. He turns on his computer and searches for Nicholas Julias on Google. He sees the picture of Nicholas trying to steal the pink crystal.

**MR. AMILI**: Gotcha, friend. Now we shall see who the real Nicholas Julias is...

## Act 3 Scene 3: The Arrest

**INT. AMILI HOUSE - EVENING**

Mr. Amili storms into the dining room, kicks open the door, points his finger at Nicholas, and screams.

**MR. AMILI**: You are guilty of trying to steal my pink rose crystal! You thief, you scoundrel!  
**NICHOLAS**: (in panic) I'm sorry... I didn't mean... I didn't know... but I was so hungry... it was a mistake!  
**ELLA**: Papa, please!  
**MR. AMILI**: I will lock you up. I will put you in jail where you belong, you filthy maggot, you animal!  
**ELLA**: Papa, please stop! Don't!  
**MR. AMILI**: I sentence you to rot in jail. You are under arrest!  
**ELLA**: Papa, if you arrest Nicholas, you have to arrest me too. I will go with Nicholas wherever he goes. I love him, Papa.  
**MR. AMILI**: Then I am sorry, but my hands are tied. I never wanted this for you. I wanted a good life for my girl. Are you sure that you want this... with him?  
**ELLA**: Yes, Papa. Wherever Nicholas goes, I will go. Wherever Nicholas lives, I will live. His fate will be my fate.  
**MR. AMILI**: Very well.  
**MRS. AMILI**: No, have mercy on our baby girl! How could you do this to her!  
**MR. AMILI**: Darling, this is out of my control. The law is the law is the law.

Both Ella and Nicholas fall to their knees. Cops lift them up into the air and throw them into jail. Mr. Amili has a single tear streaming down his cheek.

**MR. AMILI**: What have I done! I have thrown my only daughter into jail! And for what?

Everyone hugs, cries, and kisses.

**THE END**
